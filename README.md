The Python project  represents a simplified ATM banking system for ICICI Bank, implemented in Python.
Users enter their 15-digit account number and PIN to access their account details stored in a dictionary. 
They can perform operations such as displaying account details, checking the balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and changing the PIN. 
Each operation updates the account data accordingly. 
The loop continues until the user opts to exit.
